# GitHub Commit (korux-ai/korux-overture)

When the user types `commit` in chat, generate a commit message from the diff, create a git commit, and push it to GitHub. Do not ask whether to push.

## Repo context

- **Korux Overture** — open GTM strategy, content calendar, growth experiments, and metrics for [Korux.ai](https://korux.ai).
- Primary content: Markdown docs (`README.md`, strategy notes, metrics tables). No app code or build step.
- Default branch: `main`.

## Remote

- `origin` → `https://github.com/korux-ai/korux-overture.git`
- Prefer existing git credentials / `gh auth`. Never hardcode tokens in this skill or in commands.

## Workflow

Run in parallel first:

```bash
git status
git diff && git diff --cached
git log -8 --oneline
```

Then:

1. Draft a concise commit message (1–2 sentences, why not what). Match existing log language (English). For doc updates, mention the phase or section when relevant (e.g. metrics, content roadmap, Phase 2).
2. Stage the relevant changed/untracked files. Do not stage secrets the user did not intend to commit (`.env`, credentials, tokens, private keys, API keys, unpublished draft assets with sensitive data).
3. Commit with HEREDOC only:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<message>

EOF
)"
```

4. Push to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin HEAD
```

If push auth fails, use GitHub CLI (do not embed tokens in the URL):

```bash
gh auth status
git push origin HEAD
```

5. Run `git status` and report commit hash, message, and remote result.

## Rules

- Never `git config`, `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, interactive (`-i`), force push, or hard reset.
- Never amend unless the user asked, this conversation created HEAD, and it is not pushed.
- If a hook rejects the commit, fix and create a **new** commit (do not amend).
- If there is nothing to commit, stop and say so.
- Empty commit is not allowed.
- Never commit files that contain secrets; warn the user instead.
